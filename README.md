cd flashsite

npm install

# Build the frontend
npm run build

#Run The ExpressJs Server
npm run start
```

## üåê Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# HuggingFace OAuth (required for deployment)
OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_huggingface_client_id
OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_huggingface_client_secret
APP_PORT=5173
REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5173/auth/login
DEFAULT_HF_TOKEN=your_default_huggingface_token 

# OpenAI API key (required for OpenAI models)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# Google Gemini API key (required for Gemini models)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

# Optional: HF_TOKEN
# By setting this variable, you will bypass the login page + the free requests
# and will use the token directly.
# This is useful for testing purposes or local use.
HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token
```

You can copy the `.env.example` file and fill in your API keys to get started quickly.
